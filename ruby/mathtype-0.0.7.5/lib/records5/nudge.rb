# Nudge values:
# LINE, CHAR, TMPL, PILE, MATRIX, and EMBELL records may store the result of
# nudging (small offsets applied by the user). A nudged record has the
# mtefOPT_NUDGE option (0x8) and the option byte is followed immediately by
# the nudge offset. The nudge offset consists of either two bytes or six,
# depending on the amount of offset. If -128 <= dx < +128 and
# -128 <= dy < +128, then the offsets are stored as two bytes, dx followed
# by dy, where each value has 128 added to it before it is written. Otherwise,
# two bytes of 128 are stored, followed by the offsets, dx and dy, stored as
# 16-bit values, low byte followed by high byte.
